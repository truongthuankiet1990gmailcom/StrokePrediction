## ðŸ“Œ Project Description:
This project analyzes the **Healthcare Stroke Prediction Dataset** with the goal of identifying key health factors that may contribute to the risk of stroke. The dataset includes variables such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, BMI, and work type.

Using **Python**, we applied:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
- Visualizations to explore correlations and trends between features and stroke occurrence

The project not only strengthens our data analysis and visualization skills but also demonstrates how data science can support insights into public health issues. All tasks and progress were tracked using **Jira** to ensure effective team collaboration.
